**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input:
n = 5, m = 3
a[] = {89, 24, 75, 11, 23}
b[] = {89, 2, 4}

Output: 1

Explanation: 
89 is the only element 
in the intersection of two arrays.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6, m = 5
a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
b[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 

Output: 4

Explanation: 
3 4 5 and 6 are the elements 
in the intersection of two arrays.
```

## First Approach : Using nested loop and check for each element of one array into second array

```java
class Solution {
    public static int NumberofElementsInIntersection(int a[], int b[], int n, int m) {
      int count = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
                  if (a[i] == b[j]) {
                      count++;
                      b[j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // We are doing this because we do not want to count for duplicate values
                      break;
                  }
              }
      }
    return count;
}
```
In this approach the time complexity of the code will be `O(n*m)` this will give TLE during submission.

## Second Approach : Using two pointer after sorting

```java
class Solution {
    public static int NumberofElementsInIntersection(int a[], int b[], int n, int m) {
        // Sort the arrays
        Arrays.sort(a);
        Arrays.sort(b);
        
        // Find the number of elements in the intersection
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < m) {
            if (a[i] == b[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
                
                // Skip over duplicate values in both arrays
                while (i < n && a[i] == a[i - 1]) {
                    i++;
                }
                while (j < m && b[j] == b[j - 1]) {
                    j++;
                }
            } else if (a[i] < b[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
This code has a time complexity of O(nlogn + mlogm) due to the time complexity of sorting the arrays using `Arrays.sort` , <br>
and a space complexity of O(1) since we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the count variable.


## Third Approach : Using hashset

```java
class Solution {
    public static int NumberofElementsInIntersection(int a[], int b[], int n, int m) {
        // Your code here
        int count=0;
        HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for(int i : a){
            hs.add(i);
        }
        for(int i : b){
            if(hs.contains(i)){
                count++;
                hs.remove(i); //Removing elements which are already found because there is high probability that there are duplicate elements in second array.
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
}
```
The time complexity of this code is O(n + m). This is because the code iterates over both arrays once,<br>
and the time complexity of adding an element to a HashSet and checking if an element is in a HashSet is O(1).

The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the size of the first array.<br>
This is because the code creates a HashSet with a maximum size of n, which is used to store the elements of the first array.
