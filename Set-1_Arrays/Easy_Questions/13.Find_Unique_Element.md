**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A = {1, 1, 2, 5, 5}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Since 2 occurs once, while
other numbers occur twice, 
2 is the answer.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
A = {2, 2, 5, 5, 20, 30, 30}
Output: 20
Explanation:
Since 20 occurs once, while
other numbers occur twice, 
20 is the answer.
```

In question its given :
Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N)).<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).<br>

## First Approach : Iterating over the array and counting the number of occurrences of each element

```java
class Solution {
    public static int search(int[] A) {
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < A.length; j++) {
                if (A[i] == A[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count == 1) {
                return A[i];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

The code takes an input array A[] of positive integers with all numbers occurring exactly twice except for one number which occurs only once.<br>
It iterates over the array and counts the number of occurrences of each element using a nested loop. Once it has counted all the elements,<br>
it returns the element that occurs only once.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>). The space complexity is O(1).
