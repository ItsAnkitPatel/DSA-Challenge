**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input:                                                       
N = 4                                        
A[] = {1, 4, 3}
Output:
2     
Explanation:
Vaibhav placed 4 integers but he picked
up only 3 numbers. So missing number
will be 2 as it will become 1,2,3,4.
 

Example 2:

Input:                        
N = 5
A[] = {2, 5, 3, 1}
Output:
4
Explanation:
Vaibhav placed 5 integers on the board,
but picked up only 4 integers, so the
missing number will be 4 so that it
will become 1,2,3,4,5.

First Approach : Keeping track of each element presence in a new Array

```java
class Compute {
    
    public static int missingNumber(int A[], int n)
    {
         // Your code goes here
         int arr[] = new int[n+1];
         for(int i : A){
             arr[i]++;
         }

         
         for(int i =1; i<n+1; i++){
             if(arr[i] ==0){
                 return i;
             }
         }
         return n;
        
    }
}
```


The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because the code uses two loops. The first loop iterates through the input array A and takes O(n) time.<br>
The second loop iterates through the auxiliary array arr and takes O(n) time.<br>
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + n) = O(2n), which is equivalent to O(n).

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because the code creates an auxiliary array of size n+1. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).



#### We can optimize the space complexity to O(1)

```java

class Compute {
    
    public static int missingNumber(int A[], int n)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i : A){
            sum += i;
        }

        int expectedSum = (n * (n+1)) / 2;

        return expectedSum - sum;
    }
}
```
Time Complexity : O(n) <br>
Space Complexity : O(1)

üí¨ However, this approach would not work if the array A[] contains duplicate elements.
