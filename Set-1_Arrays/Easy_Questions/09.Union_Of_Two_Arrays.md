**Sample Test Cases**

```
Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 3, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
 

Example 3:

Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
m = 5, arr2[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 1 2
Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2.

```

## First Approach : Adding all unique elements of both arrays in ArrayList and then sort the ArrayList
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        for(int i =0; i<n ;i++){
            if(!(li.contains(arr1[i]))){
                li.add(arr1[i]);
            }
        }
        //Adding second array elements and at the same time checking for duplicacy
        for(int i =0; i<m; i++){
                if(!(li.contains(arr2[i]))){
                li.add(arr2[i]);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(li);
        
        return li;
        
    }
}


```


The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn).

The first loop has O(n) time complexity since it iterates over the first array, 
and the second loop has O(m) time complexity since it iterates over the second array.

However, since we assume n to be larger than m, the overall time complexity is O(n).

The time complexity of the sorting operation is O(nlogn), which dominates the time complexity of the algorithm.


The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both input arrays. <br>
We create an ArrayList with the size of n to store the union of two arrays. The space complexity of the sorting operation is O(1) since it is an in-place sorting operation.

This approach not able to pass all test cases (219/310), need more optimization.
