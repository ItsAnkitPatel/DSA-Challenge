## First Approach : Adding all unique elements of both arrays in ArrayList and then sort the ArrayList
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        for(int i =0; i<n ;i++){
            if(!(li.contains(arr1[i]))){
                li.add(arr1[i]);
            }
        }
        //Adding second array elements and at the same time checking for duplicacy
        for(int i =0; i<m; i++){
                if(!(li.contains(arr2[i]))){
                li.add(arr2[i]);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(li);
        
        return li;
        
    }
}


```


The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) or to be more precise in worst case it is O((n+m)log(n+m)).

The first loop has O(n) time complexity since it iterates over the first array, 
and the second loop has O(m) time complexity since it iterates over the second array.

However, since we assume n to be larger than m, the overall time complexity is O(n).

The time complexity of the sorting operation is O(nlogn), which dominates the time complexity of the algorithm.


The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both input arrays. <br>
We create an ArrayList with the size of n to store the union of two arrays. The space complexity of the sorting operation is O(1) since it is an in-place sorting operation.

This approach not able to pass all test cases (219/310), need more optimization.

## Second Approach : Using TreeSet 

```java
class Solution
{
  
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        set.add(arr1[i]);
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        set.add(arr2[i]);
    }
    
    return new ArrayList<Integer>(set);
    }
}
```

The time complexity of the code is `O(nlog(n)) + O(mlog(m)) + O(n+m)`, where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays, arr1 and arr2, respectively.

The first two for loops that add elements to the TreeSet run in O(nlog(n)) and O(mlog(m)) time respectively. The final operation that converts the set to an ArrayList has a time complexity of O(n+m).

The TreeSet in Java is a self-balancing binary search tree, which ensures that the elements are sorted. The add() method of TreeSet has a time complexity of O(log(n)), where n is the number of elements in the set. Therefore, the time complexity of adding n elements to a TreeSet is O(nlog(n)). Similarly, the time complexity of adding m elements to a TreeSet is O(mlog(m)).

The space complexity of the code is dominated by the TreeSet, which can hold all distinct elements from both arrays. The worst-case space complexity of a TreeSet is O(n), where n is the number of elements stored in it.
Therefore, the space complexity of the code is O(n+m) in the worst-case scenario.

## Third Approach 

```java
class Solution
{
    
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int i=0, j=0;
        
        while(i<n && j<m)
        {
            int x = arr1[i];
            int y = arr2[j];
            
            if(x<y)
            {
                ans.add(x);
                while(i<n && arr1[i]==x) i++;
            }
            else if(x==y)
            {
                ans.add(x);
                while(i<n && arr1[i]==x) i++;
                while(j<m && arr2[j]==y) j++;
            }
            else
            {
                ans.add(y);
                while(j<m && arr2[j]==y) j++;
            }
        }
        
        while(i<n)
        {
            int x = arr1[i];
            ans.add(x);
            while(i<n && arr1[i]==x) i++;
        }
        
        while(j<m)
        {
            int y = arr2[j];
            ans.add(y);
            while(j<m && arr2[j]==y) j++;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
The time complexity of this code is O(n + m).

The while loop at the beginning iterates until either i reaches n or j reaches m, so it runs in O(min(n, m)) time.

The while loop inside the if statement runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of consecutive elements in arr1 that are equal to x. Since each element can be visited at most twice (once by i and once by j), the total time spent in this loop across all iterations of the while loop at the beginning is O(n + m).

The while loops inside the else statement and at the end of the function are similar and run in O(k) time, where k is the number of consecutive elements in arr2 that are equal to y. The total time spent in these loops is also O(n + m).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(min(n, m) + (n + m)) = O(n + m).

The space complexity of this code is O(n + m) because the ArrayList answer can potentially store all the elements from both input arrays. In the worst case scenario, where there is no common element between the two arrays, the size of the ArrayList ans would be n + m. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n + m).
