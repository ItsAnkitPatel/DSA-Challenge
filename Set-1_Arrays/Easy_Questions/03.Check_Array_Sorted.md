**Sample Test Case**
```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is sorted.
```

```java
class Solution {
    boolean arraySortedOrNot(int[] arr, int n) {
        //Array of one size is already sorted
        if(n==1){
            return true;
        }
        for(int i =0; i<n-1;i++){
            //I am only checking for if any element is found greater than its neighbor then that array is not sorted in ascending order
            if(arr[i]>arr[i+1]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In worst case time complexity will be O(n) means array is sorted in increasing order.<br>
In best case means in case the first element is greater than second element then loop will only execute once and returned false so time complexity in this case is O(1). 

But we do not consider best case always so in general this code time complexity is O(n)
