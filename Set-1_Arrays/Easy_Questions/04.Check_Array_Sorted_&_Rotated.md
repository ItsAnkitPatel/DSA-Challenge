**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.

```
## First Approach
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int irregularities = 0;
        int length = nums.length;
        for (int i=0; i<length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % length])
                irregularities += 1;
        }
        return irregularities > 1 ? false : true;
    }
}
```
Here we compare all the neighboring elements and check whether they are in somewhat sorted
there will be a small change due to rotation in the array at only one place.
so if there are irregularities more than once, return false
else return true

For each index `i`, it checks whether the number at index `i` is greater than the number at index "(i+1) % length". The expression `(i+1) % length` is used to handle the case when the current index is the last index of the array. In that case, the next index should be 0 (the first index).

The time complexity of this code is O(n).
<br>

A small optimization we can do whenever we encounter more than 1 irregularities then we can directly return false because further checking other elements is waste.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int irregularities = 0;
        int length = nums.length;
        for (int i=0; i<length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % length])
                irregularities += 1;
                if(irregularities>1){
                    return false;
                }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
