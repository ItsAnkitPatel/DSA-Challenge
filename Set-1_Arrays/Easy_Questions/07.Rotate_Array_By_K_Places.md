**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

## Using Reversal Algorithm
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n; 
        reverse(nums,n-k,n-1);
        reverse(nums,0,n-k-1);
        reverse(nums,0,n-1);
    }

    void reverse(int[] arr,int start, int end){
        while(start<end){
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] =temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
When you rotate an array for example of size 7 with k value 7 then the result will be actually the original array so rotating in this case is waste.<br>
For example, if I have an array of size 29 and k is 9944 then there will be lots of rotation where you can actually get the rotated array same as given original array.<br>
9944 % 29 = 26 the number rotations decreases tremendously. 

Time complexity of this code is O(n).
