**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Array = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: {2}
Explanation: After removing all the duplicates 
only one instance of 2 will remain.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Array = {1, 2, 2}
Output: {1, 2}
```
We just need to return the unique element total size and also sort them.

## First Approach : Taking each element and running another loop for it

```java

class Solution {
    int remove_duplicate(int arr[],int n){
        int count =0;
        int max =  Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for(int i =0; i<n-1; i++){
            
            if(arr[i] != max){
                count++;
                
                for(int j = i+1; j<n; j++){
                    if(arr[i] == arr[j]){
                        arr[j] = max;
                    }
                }  
            }
        }

        //checking for last element
        if(arr[arr.length-1] != max){
            count++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr);
        return count;
    }
}

```

This approach only able to pass 580/600 test cases. After that I got TLE. <br>
Time complexity of this approach is O(n<sup>2</sup>) 
this brute force approach needed to be optimize to pass all test cases.

## Second Approach : Checking alternate elements since the given is sorted

```java
class Solution {
    int remove_duplicate(int arr[],int n){
        int count =0;
        int max =  Integer.MAX_VALUE;
//Since in the question is given that the given array is sorted that means all duplicates going to be consistent

        for(int i =0; i<n-1; i++){
            
            if(arr[i] == arr[i+1]){
                arr[i] = max;
            }
            else{
                  count++;
                }
        }
        //checking for last element
        if(arr[arr.length-1] != max){
            count++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr);
        return count;
    }
}
```


The time complexity of this code is O(n)

The outer loop iterates over the array n-1 times, and for each iteration, it only checks if the current element is equal to the next element. If they are equal, it marks the current element as a duplicate by setting it to a max value. If they are not equal, it increments the count of unique elements.

After the loop, it checks if the last element is a unique element or not. Then it sorts the array using Arrays.sort(), which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). However, since the outer loop has already identified all duplicates, the sort will only take O(n) time as all unique elements will be sorted to the beginning of the array.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n).

## Third Approach : Same complexity but concise code

```java
class Solution {
    int remove_duplicate(int arr[],int n){
        
        int position = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[position - 1]) {
                arr[position] = arr[i];
                position++;
            }

        }

        return position;
    }
}
```

The time complexity of the given code is O(n) .

The for loop iterates over the array once, comparing each element with the previous element. If the current element is different from the previous one, it is added to the output array and the position is incremented. Since the loop iterates over each element once, the time complexity is linear in the size of the array. Therefore, the time complexity of this code is O(n).
