**Sample Test Case**
```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 0, 1}
M = 1
Output:
3
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 3
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping one zero to 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 11
arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
M = 2
Output:
8
Explanation:
Maximum subarray is of size 8
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping two zeros to 1.
```

## First Approach : Use a nested loop to iterate over all possible subarrays of the given binary array, and for each subarray, count the number of zeros and ones in it

```java
class Solve {

    int findZeroes(int arr[], int n, int m) {
        int maxLen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            int zeros = 0, ones = 0;
            for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                if (arr[k] == 0) {
                    zeros++;
                } else {
                    ones++;
                }
            }
            if (zeros <= m) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, ones + zeros);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLen;
    }
}
```

This approach has a time complexity of O(N^3), since we are using two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays, <br>
and an additional loop to count the number of zeros and ones in each subarray.

After submission 31/510 test cases passed, need more optimization.

## Seond Approach : Using two pointers

```java
class Solve {
    int findZeroes(int arr[], int n, int m) {
        
        int left = 0, right = 0, zeroCount = 0, maxLen = 0;
        while (right < n) {
            if (arr[right] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            while (zeroCount > m) {
                if (arr[left] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
    return maxLen;
    }
}
```

The time complexity of the given code is O(n). This is because the code has a single while loop that iterates over the entire array 'arr' only once. Within the while loop, there are constant time operations such as addition, subtraction, comparison, and Math.max function calls, which do not depend on the size of the input array.

The loop runs from right = 0 to right = n - 1, and the while loop inside it runs from left = 0 to left = n - 1. Since each iteration of the loop increments right by 1 and potentially increments left by 1 as well, the total number of iterations of the loop is at most 2n, which gives a time complexity of O(n).

The space complexity of the given code is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of memory space irrespective of the input size. This is because the code does not use any additional data structure, and the memory required to store the variables 'left', 'right', 'zeroCount', and 'maxLen' remains constant throughout the execution of the while loop.
