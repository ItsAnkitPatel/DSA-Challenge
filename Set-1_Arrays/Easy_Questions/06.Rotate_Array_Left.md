**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: N = 7, K = 2
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2
Explanation: Rotation of the above 
array by 2 will make the output array .

Example 2:

Input: N = 6, K = 12
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

## First Approach : 

```java
class Solution
{
    void leftRotate(long arr[], int k,int n)
    {
        int position =0;
        while(k>0){
            long temp = arr[position];
            int i =0;
            for(; i<n-1 ; i++){
                arr[i] = arr[i+1];
            }
            arr[i] = temp;
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this code is O(k * n), where k is the number of rotations and n is the size of the array.

The while loop executes k times, and each iteration of the loop requires iterating through the entire array with the for loop. Therefore, the time complexity of the for loop is O(n).

Since the for loop is executed k times due to the while loop, the total time complexity of the code is O(k * n).

This code only able to pass 211/270 test cases. Need more optimization.
