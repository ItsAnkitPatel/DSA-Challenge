**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] arr) {
        if(arr.length == 1){
            return;
        }
        int position =0;
        int n = arr.length;
        for(int i =0; i <n; i++){
            if(arr[i] !=0){ //If element is non-zero then add it to the left most available position
            arr[position] =arr[i];
            position++;
            }
        }
        for(int i = position; i<n;i++){
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

The time complexity of the given code is O(n). This is because the code iterates through the entire array twice(suppose for a very large array), once to move all the non-zero elements to the left and then again to fill the remaining positions with zeros.

The first loop that moves the non-zero elements to the left has a time complexity of O(n), as it needs to iterate through each element of the array. Within the loop, the operations are constant time, which means that the time complexity of this loop is O(1) for each iteration.

The second loop that fills the remaining positions with zeros also has a time complexity of O(n), as it needs to iterate through each remaining element of the array. Like the first loop, the operations within this loop are constant time, which means that the time complexity of this loop is also O(1) for each iteration.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n + n) = O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).


One better and intuitive solution I found, but same time complexity : [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/solutions/172432/the-easiest-but-unusual-snowball-java-solution-beats-100-o-n-clear-explanation/?orderBy=most_votes)
