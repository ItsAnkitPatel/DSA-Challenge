**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: N = 7, K = 2
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2
Explanation: Rotation of the above 
array by 2 will make the output array .

Example 2:

Input: N = 6, K = 12
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

## First Approach : 

```java
class Solution
{
    void leftRotate(long arr[], int k,int n)
    {
        int position =0;
        while(k>0){
            long temp = arr[position];
            int i =0;
            for(; i<n-1 ; i++){
                arr[i] = arr[i+1];
            }
            arr[i] = temp;
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this code is O(k * n), where k is the number of rotations and n is the size of the array.

The while loop executes k times, and each iteration of the loop requires iterating through the entire array with the for loop. Therefore, the time complexity of the for loop is O(n).

Since the for loop is executed k times due to the while loop, the total time complexity of the code is O(k * n).

This code only able to pass 211/270 test cases. Need more optimization.

## Second Approach : Use reversal algorithm

**Reversal Algorithm:**

* Reverse the elements of the array from index 0 to k-1.
* Reverse the elements of the array from index k to n-1.
* Reverse the entire array.
This algorithm takes O(n) time complexity.

```java
class Solution{
void leftRotate(long arr[], int k, int n) {
        k = k % n;
        reverse(arr, 0, k-1);
        reverse(arr, k, n-1);
        reverse(arr, 0, n-1);
    }
    
    void reverse(long arr[], int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            long temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
     }
}
```
