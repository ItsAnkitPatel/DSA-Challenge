**Sample Test Cases**
```
Test Case 1:
Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.


Test Case 2:

Input: 
N = 3
Arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of 
the array is 10 and the second 
largest element is 5.
```

## First Approach : Sort the array and traverse the array from second last index


```java

class Solution {
    int print2largest(int arr[], int n) {
       Arrays.sort(arr);
       for(int i =n-2; i>=0; i--){
           if(arr[i]<arr[i+1]){
               return arr[i];
           }
       }
       return -1;
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n).

The reason for this is that the method uses the built-in Java method 'Arrays.sort()' to sort the input array in ascending order, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).

After sorting the array, the method loops through it backwards starting from the second-to-last element, checking if each element is less than its successor. If it finds an element that is less than its successor, it returns that element.

In the worst case, the loop will iterate through all n-1 elements of the array, giving a time complexity of O(n). However, this is a relatively small cost compared to the time complexity of the sort operation. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the method is O(n log n).

## Second Approach: keep the track of current first and second maximum number inside array 

```java
class Solution {
    int print2largest(int arr[], int n) {
       int max =-1, secmax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
       for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
           if(max<arr[i]){
               if(secmax<max){
                   secmax = max;
               }
               max = arr[i];
           }else if(secmax < arr[i] && arr[i]<max){
               
               secmax = arr[i];
           }
       }
       return secmax ;
    }
}
```




The time complexity of this code is O(n).

The method loops through the entire array once, and performs a constant number of operations on each element. Therefore, the time complexity of the loop is O(n).

Within the loop, the method keeps track of the two largest values seen so far using two variables 'max' and 'secmax'. It updates these variables based on the value of the current element in the array.

The maximum number of comparisons that are performed for each element is two, and these comparisons are done in constant time. Therefore, the time complexity of these operations is also O(n).
