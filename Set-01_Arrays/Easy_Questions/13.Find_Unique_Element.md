**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A = {1, 1, 2, 5, 5}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Since 2 occurs once, while
other numbers occur twice, 
2 is the answer.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
A = {2, 2, 5, 5, 20, 30, 30}
Output: 20
Explanation:
Since 20 occurs once, while
other numbers occur twice, 
20 is the answer.

In question its given :
Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N)).<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).<br>

## First Approach : Iterating over the array and counting the number of occurrences of each element

```java
class Solution {
    public static int search(int[] A) {
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < A.length; j++) {
                if (A[i] == A[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count == 1) {
                return A[i];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

The code takes an input array A[] of positive integers with all numbers occurring exactly twice except for one number which occurs only once.<br>
It iterates over the array and counts the number of occurrences of each element using a nested loop. Once it has counted all the elements,<br>
it returns the element that occurs only once.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>). The space complexity is O(1).

<br>

## Second Approach : Using XOR operator

```java
class Sol
{
    public static int search(int A[], int N)
    {
        int ans =0;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
            ans = ans ^ A[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
A^B^B = A

B^B = 0

B^0 = B

With this property of xor we can use it to delete duplicate elements and find unique element in the array

Time complexity : O(N)
Space complexity : O(1)


<br>

## Third Approach : Using Binary Search because given array is already sorted

```java
class Sol {
    public static int search(int A[], int N) {
        if(N==1){
        return A[0];
        }
        int low = 0, high = N - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if ((mid == 0 || A[mid] != A[mid - 1]) && (mid == N - 1 || A[mid] != A[mid + 1])) {
                return A[mid];
            } else if (mid % 2 == 0 && A[mid] == A[mid + 1]) {
                low = mid + 2;
            } else if (mid % 2 == 1 && A[mid] == A[mid - 1]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
Time complexity : O(log n)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)

<summary>Explanation of code</summary>

Let's take the example of the input array A = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] and run through the function search step by step to see how it works.

1. Initially, the function search receives the array A and its size N, which is 7. Then, it initializes two variables low and high to 0 and 6 respectively, which represent the indices of the first and last elements of the array.

First iteration of the while loop:
The condition low <= high is true, so the while loop is entered. In the first iteration, mid is calculated as mid = low + (high - low) / 2 = 3.

Then, the following if statement is checked:
```
if ((mid == 0 || A[mid] != A[mid - 1]) && (mid == N - 1 || A[mid] != A[mid + 1]))
```
Since mid is not equal to 0 and A[mid] is equal to A[mid - 1], this condition is false.

Next, the following else-if statement is checked:
```
else if (mid % 2 == 0 && A[mid] == A[mid + 1])
```

Since mid is even and A[mid] is equal to A[mid + 1], this condition is true. Therefore, the value of low is updated to low = mid + 2 = 5, which means that the search for the unique element continues in the right half of the array.

2. Second iteration of the while loop:
In the second iteration, mid is calculated as mid = low + (high - low) / 2 = 6.

Then, the following if statement is checked:
```
if ((mid == 0 || A[mid] != A[mid - 1]) && (mid == N - 1 || A[mid] != A[mid + 1]))
```
Since mid is equal to N - 1, this condition is true, and A[mid] is returned as the unique element.

3. Final output:
The function search returns the value of A[mid], which is 4. Therefore, the unique element in the input array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] is 4.

So, this is how the function search works step by step to find the unique element in the input array.
