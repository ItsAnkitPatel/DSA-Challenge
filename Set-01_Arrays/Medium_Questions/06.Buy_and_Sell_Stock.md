**Sample Test Cases**
```
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## First Approach : Keeping track of each buying and selling pair profit

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length==1){
            return 0;
        }
        int max = 0;
        int n = prices.length;
        for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j =i+1; j<n; j++){
                if(prices[j]-prices[i]>max){
                    max =prices[j]-prices[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

Time Complexity : Approx O(n<sup>2</sup>)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)

## Second Approach

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length==1){
            return 0;
        }
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit=0;
        for(int i =0; i<prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i]<minPrice){
                minPrice = prices[i];
            }else{
                int profit = prices[i]-minPrice;
                if(profit>maxProfit){
                    maxProfit= profit;
                }
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

Time Complexity : O(n)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)

In this approach, we keep track of the minimum price seen so far and update it whenever we find a new minimum price.<br>
For each subsequent price, we calculate the profit that could be made by selling on that day, and update the maximum profit if it's greater than the previous maximum profit.
